# Client-Server-Development
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
The CRUD Python module made the program easier to maintain and adapt by its seperated database operations from the dashboard and the modular design allows me to reuse it for any future projects.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
How I approach a problem as a computer scientist is by breaking down the database operations and user interface requirements. I focused on structuring the data for client nees and using CRUD functions ensures that the data can be managed easily and reused amongst different request.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientist solve problems by building tools to improve efficiency. The dashboard helps Grazioso Salvare filter and analyze animal data quickly and helps make better operational decisions.
